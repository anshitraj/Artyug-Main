## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)

- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)
- Supabase account (for backend)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Flutter**
   ```bash
   # Check Flutter installation
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Get Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd flutter_app
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Supabase**
   - The Supabase configuration is already set in `lib/config/supabase_config.dart`
   - Update if needed with your Supabase URL and anon key

4. **Configure API Keys**
   - Update `lib/config/api_config.dart` with your Gemini AI API key if needed

5. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   flutter run -d ios

   # For Android
   flutter run -d android
   ```

## Stitch MCP Setup

This repo includes a project MCP config at `.mcp.json` for Stitch:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stitch": {
      "serverUrl": "https://stitch.googleapis.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Goog-Api-Key": "${STITCH_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Add your key in `.env`:
   - `STITCH_API_KEY=...`
2. If your MCP client does not expand environment variables in JSON headers, replace `${STITCH_API_KEY}` directly in `.mcp.json` with the real key.
3. Restart your MCP client/session.

OAuth alternative:
- Replace headers with:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`
  - `X-Goog-User-Project: <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`
- Refresh the access token when it expires (typically ~1 hour).

## Dependencies

Key dependencies used:
- `supabase_flutter`: Backend integration
- `go_router`: Navigation
- `provider`: State management
- `google_generative_ai`: AI assistant
- `cached_network_image`: Image caching

- And more...

## Notes

- Some screens are placeholder implementations and need to be fully developed
- The Communities screen is fully implemented as an example

## Converting from React Native

This Flutter app maintains the same structure and functionality as the original React Native app:
- Same Supabase backend
- Same navigation flow
- Same UI/UX patterns
- Same features and screens

## Development

To contribute or extend:
1. Follow Flutter best practices
2. Use the existing code structure as a template
3. Implement remaining screens following the Communities screen pattern
4. Test on both iOS and Android

## License

Same as the original React Native app.
